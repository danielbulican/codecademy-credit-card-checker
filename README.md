Here is how I solved the codecademy Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker. The goal of this project was to write a program that checks whether a credit card number is valid or invalid. For the invalid numbers I had to determine which company issued it based on the first digit.

The program consists of three functions: 1. validateCred() takes an array of numbers representing a potential credit card number. It then loops through the array and applies the Luhn's algorithm to it. Here is description of this algorithm taken from codecademy: "The calculations in the Luhn algorithm can be broken down as the following steps:
    Starting from the farthest digit to the right, AKA the check digit, iterate to the left.
    As you iterate to the left, every other digit is doubled (the check digit is not doubled). If the number is greater than 9 after doubling, subtract 9 from its value.
    Sum up all the digits in the credit card number.
    If the sum modulo 10 is 0 (if the sum divided by 10 has a remainder of 0) then the number is valid, otherwise, itâ€™s invalid."

Finally, validateCred() will return true or false based on if it satisfies the condition of this algorithm.

2. findInvalidCards() is a function that takes in a nested array as parameter. The subarrays are credit card numbers. It loops through the nested arrays and filters out all the valid credit card numbers and returs an array containing only invalid numbers.


3. idInvalidCardCompanies() takes a nested array of invalid credit card numbers. It loops through this array and checks the first digit of each subarray. It then appends the name of the credit card company to the companiesArr depending on what digit that was. It avoids duplicate company names in the companiesArr by checking if the name of the comapany is not already there.
